# Wine quality prediction

In this repository is a jupyter notebook in which I apply several out-of-box
regressors included in Sklearn to compare their performance. The used dataset
[1] contains objective features of red and white wine and subjective rating of
quality of these samples on a scale from 0 (very bad) to 10 (very excellent).
